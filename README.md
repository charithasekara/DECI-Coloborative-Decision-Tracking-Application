# Deci - Collaborative Decision Dashboard for Learning (CCDL)

## Overview

Deci is a lightweight web-based application designed to streamline organizational decision management. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with Tailwind CSS, Deci provides a centralized platform to document, track, and analyze decisions, ensuring transparency and knowledge retention. It leverages a **Layered Architecture** to enhance maintainability, scalability, and usability.

## Purpose

Deci addresses the challenges of tracking decisions in fast-paced environments, where issues like lost information, repeated discussions, and lack of transparency often arise. It achieves this by:

- Documenting decision details (context, stakeholders, impact).
- Enabling collaboration and knowledge retention.
- Providing analytics for data-driven insights.

## Features

- **Intuitive UI**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS (e.g., `md:grid-cols-2` layouts).
- **Decision Logging**: Capture decisions with context via structured forms.
- **Analytics**: Visualize trends using Chart.js in `dashboard/page.tsx`.
- **Timelines**: Display recent decisions chronologically.
- **Dashboards**: Present metrics in a grid layout (e.g., total decisions, high-impact decisions).
- **Impact Scoring**: Highlight decisions with scores â‰¥ 8.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete decisions via `decisionApi`.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes with optimized performance.

## Software Architecture

Deci adopts a **Layered Architecture**, dividing the system into three layers:

### Presentation Layer

- **Location**: `app/` and `components/` directories.
- **Details**: `dashboard/page.tsx` renders metrics in a responsive grid, and `app/decisions/` manages CRUD forms with Tailwind CSS for mobile responsiveness.
- **Purpose**: Ensures an accessible, user-friendly interface.

### Business Logic Layer

- **Location**: `lib/` directory.
- **Details**: `api.ts` supports `decisionApi.getAll({ limit: 1000 })` for scalable reads and CRUD operations, while `analytics.ts` handles impact scoring.
- **Purpose**: Manages decision processing and performance.

### Data Layer

- **Location**: `models/` and `routes/` directories.
- **Details**: `models/Decisions.js` defines decision structures, and `routes/decisions.js` maps API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/decisions`).
- **Purpose**: Maintains data consistency and secure API interactions.

## Development Challenges

| **Challenge**            | **Solution**                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overwhelming Forms**   | Implemented stepwise forms in `app/decisions/` with Tailwind CSS.  |
| **UI Clarity**           | Enhanced responsiveness in `dashboard/page.tsx` with Tailwind CSS. |
| **Secret Leaks**         | Updated `.gitignore` and removed `.env` via `git rebase`.          |
| **CRUD Performance**     | Added pagination in `lib/api.ts` with `decisionApi.getAll()`.      |
| **Responsive Analytics** | Optimized `dashboard/page.tsx` with Tailwind CSS layouts.          |
| **TypeScript Errors**    | Simplified code and updated `tsconfig.json`.                       |
| **Form Validation**      | Added client-side validation in `app/decisions/`.                  |
| **Data Fetching**        | Improved `lib/api.ts` with error handling.                         |
| **Large Timelines**      | Used lazy loading in `dashboard/page.tsx`.                         |
| **Theme Performance**    | Cached styles in local storage for theme toggle.                   |
